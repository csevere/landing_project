	2. Open terminal interface: https://hyper.is/
	3. Download my starter pack for making a website 
	4. Check my package.json to make sure I have all my starter dependencies and then npm install.
	5. Select CSS frameworks: Bootstrap 4/ CSS Grid
	6. Preprocessor: Sass
	7. Browser: Google Chrome
	8. tools: 
		a. gulp > set up a live server, compile Sass to CSS, refresh browser everytime I save, optimize all my assets (CSS, JS, fonts, images) for production 
		b. Google's Dev-tools to debug
		c. Bitnami MAMP Stack for php and database 
	9. Create a repo on github
	10. Adhere to a proper coding style 
	11. Create issues/branches on github for organization/debugging/testing
